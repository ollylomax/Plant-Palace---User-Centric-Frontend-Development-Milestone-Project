# Plant Palace Website
I made this website using my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks and UX Design which I have learned from Code Institute during my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. The shop was made up by myself with the intention of completing my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. I went slightly out of scope for the project in order to learn as much as I possibly could during the development process. From scope to testing has taken me just under 10 days.



View the live project [here](https://ollylomax.github.io/Plant-Palace---User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/index.html).

The owners of Plant Palace wanted a fully responsive website with the purpose of showcasing their collection of house plants on sale, providing information and advice about the more popular species of house plants and giving a personal background on their journey and experiences. They wish to garner interest from users to both visit their local store and sign up to their mailing list.

-   ### Structure
    **As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate seamlessly through the site so that I can get to the intended page quickly.**

    At the top of every page there will be a navigation bar. This will include:
    - **Plant Palace Logo** which will link back to the home page(index.html) when clicked on.
    - **Home** button which will link to the 'Home' page(index.html) when clicked on.
    - **Plants** button which will link to the 'Plants' page(plants.html) when clicked on.
    - **Our Story** button which will link to the 'Our Story' page(ourstory.html) when clicked on.
    - **Find Us** button which will link to the 'Find Us' page(findus.html) when clicked on.

    At the bottom of every page there will be a consistent footer. This will include:
     - Information block containing Plant Palace Address, Phone Number and Email Address.
     - Anchor links:
       - **Newsletter** which opens a modal window for mailing list sign up when clicked on.
       - **About Us** which directs the user to the 'Our Story' page(ourstory.html) when clicked on.
       - **Contact Us** which directs the user to the specific part of the 'Find Us' page containing the form.
     - Social media block containing:
       - **Facebook** link which will open a new window for the user when clicked on.
       - **Twitter** link which will open a new window for the user when clicked on.
       - **Instagram** link which will open a new window for the user when clicked on.
       - **YouTube** link which will open a new window for the user when clicked on.
       - **Pinterest** link which will open a new window for the user when clicked on.

    If the user attempts to type the website in manually and makes a spelling error, then they are taken to a specific error 404 page(404.html) with clear direction back to the home page.

    The **Hero image** will be the first section of the Home page. This will contain:
     - Large background image of staff member kneeling down over stock plants.
     - Title box containing h1 heading describing exactly what the purpose of the website is.
     - Callout form offering 10% discount in store for signing up to the mailing list.

    The **Introduction** section will be the second section of the Home page. This will contain:
     - Background image of plant.
     - Short introduction about the company.

    A small **Plants** section will be the final section of the Home page. This will contain:
     - Image of two plants.
     - Short teaser description for each plant.
     - Buttons directing to the more detailed descriptions and advice on Plants page.


-   ### Design

    - #### Colour Scheme

        ![Green #096501](docs/readmepics/096501.png)
        ![Dark Green #133510](docs/readmepics/133510.png)
        ![Off-White #FFF](docs/readmepics/fff.png)

        I used three main colours for the website. A **green** for the main theme, a **dark green** for borders and smaller elements and an **off-white** for a clean contrast against both. I felt like they complimented each other well, related well to the house plant theme and provided the necessary contrast to use almost exclusively throughout the design process.

    - #### Typography

        I used two main fonts for the website, **Titillium** and **Roboto** which are both well recognised and a standard in web design.

    - #### Imagery

        I designed a simple logo with CSS styling which is present in the navigation of each page. There are an array of plant images across the site taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which is a free resource for stock images. They have been selected with as much uniformity as possible. There are also images relating to the journey and location of the imaginary owners, the interior and exterior of the imaginary shop as well as portrait images pertaining to fake user reviews.

    - [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)<br>
        CSS Validator used to ensure there were no syntax errors in styling.



## Testing
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors. Both returned **no errors** for every page.

WAVE was used for contrast testing and returned **no contrast errors** for every page.

Lighthouse was used for performance, accessibility and SEO testing and returned scores of **90-100** for every page.

I ran the website locally and tested on the deployed version. No differences found.

- ## Test Strategy
The testing will be performed only on the aesthetics, visual effects and layout of the website as any back-end functionality is out of scope for this project.

- This will be done on four web browsers:-
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Brave

 - And on every common breakpoint (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, XL Desktop).

 Validation of feature inclusion will be undertaken from the wireframes scoped during the Skeleton stage of UX design.
 
 Elements should not overlap other container divs and should remain on the screen at all sizes above and including 300px.

 All nav links should direct to the intended pages applicable to their names (with the exception of the Home page directing to index.html).

 Form validation will be undertaken to ensure the correct inputs are posted and that all fields are required. This will be done with Code Institute's form dump which I used during the learning modules.

 Social media links should open in new browser windows.

The live project is deployed [here](https://ollylomax.github.io/Plant-Palace---User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/index.html).
