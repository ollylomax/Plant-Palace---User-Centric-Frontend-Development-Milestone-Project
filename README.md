# Plant Palace Website
I made this website using my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JQuery framework and UX Design which I have learned from Code Institute during my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. The shop was made up by myself with the intention of completing my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. I went slightly out of scope for the project in order to learn as much as I possibly could during the development process. From scope to testing has taken me just under 10 days.

The owners of Plant Palace wanted a fully responsive website with the purpose of showcasing their collection of house plants on sale, providing information and advice about the more popular species of house plants and giving a personal background on their journey and experiences. They wish to garner interest from users to both visit their local store and sign up to their mailing list.

-   ### Design

    - #### Colour Scheme

        ![Green #096501](docs/readmepics/096501.png)
        ![Dark Green #133510](docs/readmepics/133510.png)
        ![Off-White #FFF](docs/readmepics/fff.png)

        I used three main colours for the website. A **green** for the main theme, a **dark green** for borders and smaller elements and an **off-white** for a clean contrast against both. I felt like they complimented each other well, related well to the house plant theme and provided the necessary contrast to use almost exclusively throughout the design process.

    - #### Typography

        I used two main fonts for the website, **Titillium** and **Roboto** which are both well recognised and a standard in web design.

    - #### Imagery

        I designed a simple logo with CSS styling which is present in the navigation of each page. There are an array of plant images across the site taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which is a free resource for stock images. They have been selected with as much uniformity as possible. There are also images relating to the journey and location of the imaginary owners, the interior and exterior of the imaginary shop as well as portrait images pertaining to fake user reviews.
